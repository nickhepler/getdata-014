# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project #

## Objective ##
The [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/nickhepler/getdata-014/blob/master/project/run_analysis.R) script is designed to create a tidy data set from data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Process ##
1.  Download and extract the data from the following [link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
1.  Download the [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/nickhepler/getdata-014/blob/master/project/run_analysis.R) script into the same directory.
1.  Run the run_analysis.R script in `R` by running `source("./run_analysis.R")` the following command from the working directory.
1.  The data will be stored in a new file named data_set_with_the_avgs.txt under the data directory.
